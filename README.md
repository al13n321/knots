Trying to implement real-time more-or-less physically correct simulation of a rope in vr, so that it can be tied into knots, waved around like a whip, twisted into a helical tangle like earphones cable, etc.

I have some ideas for how to do this efficiently, but not sure if it's going to be quite efficient enough.

Currently there's not much to see here, hardly anything is done.

A lot of utility code is copied from my old repos. Code style is somewhat inconsistent because of that. Some parts are also messy, redundant, or bad in other ways. I don't care about all that for now, just want to see if the core ideas are workable.
